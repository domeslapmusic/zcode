<p><strong>What I know about SVN</strong> is an introduction to SVN for beginners/average users that I prepared to support my talk <a href="http://www.lfpug.com/31st-july-2008-31072008/">SVN for Flash at LFPUG on July 2008</a>. You can <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>assets/articles/what-i-know-about-svn/What-I-know-about-SVN.pdf">download it as PDF</a> and view the recorded presentation here: <a href="http://www.lfpug.com/source-control-for-flash/">Source control for Flash</a>.</p>
<p>It has also been translated by Cay Garrido (aka <a href="http://www.ventdaval.com/">VentdAval</a>) to Spanish as part of <a href="http://www.loqueyosede.com/">Lo que yo s&eacute; de</a> (&quot;What I know about&quot;): <a href="http://loqueyosede.com/svn/">Lo que yo s&eacute; de SVN</a>.</p>
