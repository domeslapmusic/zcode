<p><a href="http://www.m-learning.org/">m-learning</a> is an e-learning platform for mobile devices. It consists in a Windows-based desktop tool to create the content and a Flash-based application that runs on the devices. That Flash application also communicates with a remote server to keep user statistics.</p>
<p>My work consisted in planification Flash estructure, developing the generic Flash player for the especific activities. The Flash player works on:
<ul>
<li>Windows Mobile based PDAs, inside our own C wrapper.</li>
<li>In any regular PC, inside Screenweaver.</li>
<li>In a browser, giving up some of the features (basically file system access).</li>
</ul>
