<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: What you are going to see is my Hello World of Flash games. And it's *far* from being finished, but otherwise I wouldn't upload it ever! I still have to do all the &quot;nice&quot; like scores, instructions and so on.</p>

<div id="container"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
	
	var so = new SWFObject("<?php echo base_url(); ?>assets/projects/snake/zsnake","zsnake","300","300","8","#ffffff");
	so.write("container");
	
// ]]>
</script>

<p>You can get the code from <a href="projects/zcode">ZCode</a>.</p>
